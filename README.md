## Project
<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src='image/fraud.jpeg'> **[Unmasking Deception: Advanced Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://github.com/katasrofi/fraud_detection)**

In this project, I employed statistical methods including Anderson-Darling, Shapiro-Wilk, and Skewness, to explore the data and implemented machine learning models such as Neural Network, Catboost, SGDClassifier, Logistic Regression, and GaussianNB for outcome prediction.

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src='image/ads.png'> **[Assessing the Impact of New Advertising Campaign vs Old Campaign: An A/B testing Portfolio Project](https://github.com/katasrofi/a-b_testing/blob/main/README.md#assessing-the-impact-of-new-advertising-campaign-vs-old-campaign-an-ab-testing-portfolio-project)**

The primary objective of this project is to perform an in-depth analysis to determine the optimal advertising strategy for the market. Utilizing A/B testing methodologies, specifically the Chi-square Contingency method, will guide us in making well-informed decisions for our new advertising campaign.
